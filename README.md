My Linux Prefix Project

Main goals:

* I run into old, sometimes very old, versions of Linux at client sites. I want to be able to use some modern tools.
* Build a set of tools that sit outside of the normal /bin, /sbin, /usr/bin, /usr/sbin, etc.
* Build a set of tools that won't interfere with the pre-existing installed tools
* Don't require additional users be added to the Linux box
* Build a reasonable set of new tools on the old distribution
* Give myself a platform and a methodology for building complex Linux source packages.
